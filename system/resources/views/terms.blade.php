CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL PRIZES <br>
Rewards / Discounts may not be exchanged for any cash or other alternative (unless stated) and Reward Vouchers(s) / discounts are non-negotiable, non-transferable, and non-divisible and are not permitted to be sold or resold.<br>
Neither the Promoter nor any redeeming outlet shall be under any obligation to enquire whether the person submitting any voucher code is the person entitled to make the claim, irrespective as to whether or not that person first obtained that voucher code (but without affecting the Promoter's rights concerning anyone in breach of these Terms and Conditions).<br>
ALL voucher(s) will be retained on redemption (unless redeemed via a hotline or online, when the Prize Partner and or Promoter reserves the right to require prior sight of any voucher(s) before redemption) and only Original and Authentic voucher unique codes will be accepted. VOID voucher unique codes will not be accepted (expired, counterfeit, or incomplete).<br>
All pictures and photos used to advertise the prizes are illustrative rather than definitive and are for reference only, the actual prizes may differ in their appearance.<br>
Any advertisement of the cash value of the prize-pool represents the Promoter’s best estimate of the normal retail-price or (in the case of discount prizes) of the discount offered (based in turn on the average discount if variable) for all prizes which are available to be won; it does not thereby imply that any prize will be awarded in the absence of a corresponding valid claim.<br>
Reproduction of any prize imagery does not thereby imply any endorsement or association by the producer of that prize type nor by the owner of any brand associated with that prize type and the award of which has been completed within the time limits as prescribed by these Terms & Conditions.<br>
<br>
RESPONSIBILITY<br>
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (but not otherwise) the Promoter, its agents for administering the reward vouchers assume no responsibility and are not liable for: (i) the accuracy or otherwise of the prize description or illustration, (ii) the non-availability, loss, interception or interference with, late receipt or damage of or to any prize claim, Promotional reward vouchers, discount prize(s), voucher(s), prize or notification or other communication, (iii) (other than those warranties or conditions implied by statute and which cannot be excluded by the Promoter) any representation, warranty, condition or guarantee in respect of a prize, or (iv) any taxes, fees, charges or other costs which winners may be required to pay at any time in connection with a prize, (save to the extent that the Promoter has expressly and specifically accepted responsibility in these Terms and Conditions for the same) (v) all costs, injuries, losses or damages of any kind, due in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, to a person’s participation in the Promotion, or arising out of a person’s participation in any Promotion related activity, or their receipt, use or misuse of any prize that may be awarded to them.<br>
<br>
All reward vouchers remain the property of the Promoter, pending redemption to winners and the Promoter reserves the right to dispose of any unclaimed prizes as they deem appropriate.<br>
All prizes remain the property of the Prize Partners, pending redemption by winners and the Promoter is not responsible for the supply of and does not own, any prizes provided by other suppliers nor acts as their agent concerning the delivery to winners of prizes other than those supplied directly by the Promoter.<br>
For any prize which must be claimed by the winners' parent / legal guardian, the Promoter will not be obliged to award it to anyone other than that parent / legal guardian, if the winner is less than 18 years of age. The Promoter may also withhold that award should the Promoter determine in its sole discretion that a dispute may have arisen between the winner and the parent / legal guardian concerning the prize.<br>
The Promoter is not liable to verify the identity of the parent or legal guardian.<br>
The submission of prize claims is the sole responsibility of the prize claimant. Any tax liability or life, health, travel, accident or other insurance associated with any prize is payable by the prize winner and is their sole responsibility.<br>
